My (somewhat opinionated) Python project template

- minimal configuration in [[file:setup.py]], only setting the required fields
 
  No one cares about PyPi keywords, descriptions etc.
- uses pytest and mypy for checks
- relies on [[file:tox.ini][tox]] for running tests and checks in isolation
- uses Github Actions for CI

  - can be used by anyone with Github account when they fork a project

    UPD: ugh. Apparently github actions
    [[https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Will-GitHub-Actions-support-pull-request-events-from-a-fork-to-a/td-p/44488][won't]] run against merge requests from the forked repositories (i.e. pretty much all merge request by other people).

  - build matrix for multiple python versions
  - trying to keep as little as possible in the CI configuration
   
    Because [[https://beepb00p.xyz/configs-suck.html][fuck]] yaml configs and learning yet another templating syntax
- automatic PyPi deployments on new tags

* CI
- see [[file:.github/workflows/main.yml][the config]]
- running CI locally: use [[https://github.com/nektos/act][=act=]] (e.g. try with =act -l=)

* PyPi releases

#+begin_src python :results output drawer :exports results
import imp
m = imp.load_source('release', '.ci/release')
print(m.__doc__)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:

Run [[file:scripts/release][scripts/release]] to deploy Python package onto [[https://pypi.org][PyPi]] and [[https://test.pypi.org][test PyPi]].

The script expects =TWINE_PASSWORD= environment variable to contain the [[https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken][PyPi token]] (not the password!).

The script can be run manually.
It's also running as =pypi= job in [[file:.github/workflows/main.yml][Github Actions config]]. Packages are deployed on:
- every master commit, onto test pypi
- every new tag, onto production pypi

You'll need to set =TWINE_PASSWORD= and =TWINE_PASSWORD_TEST= in [[https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets][secrets]]
for Github Actions deployment to work.

# TODO maybe generate github actions config and have a literal readme?
